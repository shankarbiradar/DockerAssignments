Your supermarket company is working on expanding their Docker infrastructure. They have an existing service that provides a list of fruit sold in their stores. After measuring the amount of load on this service, they have asked you to scale this service up to a higher number of replicas.

In addition, there is a new service that provides a list of vegetables. This new service needs to be created in the cluster. Set up the swarm cluster to complete the lab, ensure that the swarm meets the following specifications:

1. Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
2. Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
3. Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
4. Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.

You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.

Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.

Good luck!

Solution: 
               1). Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
                    $ docker service create --name products-fruit -p 8080:80 linuxacademycontent/fruit-service
                    # First  i have created the service called products-fruit wih an image fruit-service.
                
                    $ docker service scale products-fruit=5
                    # now scale the service with five replicas for products-fruit

               2). Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
                    $docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172..17.0.88(Taken katakoda terminal ipaddress)
                    # First we have to create swarm manager and then join to worker nodes
   
                    $docker service create --name products-vegetables -p 8081:80 linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0
                    # Created one more service called products-vegeteble with vegetebles-service:1.0.0 image version.

               3). Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
                    $ curl http://172.17.0.32:8081
       
               4).  Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.
                     $ docker service update --replicas 3 products-vegetables


                   You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.
                       $ curl http://172.17.0.32:8080

                   Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.
                       $ curl http://172.17.0.32:8081
